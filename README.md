# Dental_Insurance_Fee_Analysis_and_Negotiations

This is a project I did while working in a dental office, where I compare our insurance fees with other offices and negotiate with insurance companies for higher rates.

## Purpose: 
-Gather data to compare our rates with other office's rates to prove that we will need to re-negotiate our fee schedules.

-Understand which insurance companies are negotiable, and which companies are needed to negotiate more than others.

-To analyze data so that my dentist can make well-informed decisions when negotiating fees with insurance companies. 

## Structure:
### 1. [Insurance utilization report](https://github.com/and33zy/Insurance-utilization-report)
   * This report generated by using SQL to compile data to showcase how much revenue has been generated from individual insurance plans.
   * Describes how many claims, estimated payouts, and actual payouts from all insurance plans used in the dental office.
   * These details also depict how much insurance companies payout versus how much they are estimated to pay. The difference is crucial when quoting patients on expensive procedures.
   * Highlights the most common insurance plans that patients use.
   * This report is significant because it helps me and our dentist figure out which insurance plan is the most unpredictable in terms of payout, which ones we are okay to leave contract with, and which ones we can put less focus on improving.

### 2. [Procedures by Procedure Code](https://github.com/and33zy/Procedures-by-Procedure-Code.git)
   * A report generated by using OpenDental, an open source dental management program, that tracks all known procedure codes used in our office.
   * Has a brief description of each procedure code used, the number of times a procedure code has been used between 01-Jan-2022 to 31-Dec-2022, how much revenue generated by each code and average fees based on all insurance company's fee schedule.
